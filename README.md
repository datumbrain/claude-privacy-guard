# Claude Privacy Guard

> 🛡️ Prevent secrets and PII from being accidentally shared with Claude Code.

A privacy-first plugin for Claude Code that scans prompts for sensitive data and **blocks** them before they reach the AI.

## Features

- ✅ **Blocks prompts** containing sensitive data before they're sent to Claude
- ✅ **Detects** PII, secrets, API keys, tokens, and sensitive information
- ✅ **Works locally** - all scanning happens on your machine
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- ✅ **Detailed reporting** - shows exactly what was detected

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add datumbrain/claude-privacy-guard

# Install the plugin
/plugin install claude-privacy-guard
```

> **⚠️ Important: Restart Required**
>
> After installing the plugin, you must **restart your Claude Code session** for it to take effect. This is because hooks are registered at session startup - Claude Code doesn't dynamically load new hooks mid-session.
>
> Simply close and reopen Claude Code, or start a new session.

Once restarted, the plugin will automatically scan all prompts before they reach Claude.

## What Gets Detected

✅ **Secrets**
- OpenAI API keys (`sk-...`, `sk-proj-...`)
- AWS credentials
- GitHub tokens
- Stripe keys
- JWT tokens
- Bearer tokens
- SSH private keys
- Generic API key patterns

✅ **Personal Information (PII)**
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers

## How It Works

1. You type a prompt in Claude Code
2. Privacy Guard intercepts it via a `UserPromptSubmit` hook
3. Scans for sensitive data using regex patterns
4. **Blocks the prompt** if sensitive data is found
5. Shows you exactly what was detected

## Example

**Input:**
```
My API key is sk-proj-abc123xyz and email is john@example.com
```

**Result:**
```
🛡️ Privacy Guard blocked this prompt

Found 2 sensitive item(s):
  - API_KEY: sk-proj-abc123xyz...
  - EMAIL: john@example.com...

Risk Score: 100/100
Secrets: 1 | PII: 1

Please remove or anonymize sensitive data before proceeding.
```


## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/datumbrain/claude-privacy-guard.git
cd claude-privacy-guard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Test the scanner directly
echo "test sk-proj-abc123" | node scripts/prompt-guard.js
```

Release:
```bash
make release
```
This runs an interactive flow that asks for version bump, confirms release actions, then runs build/test, creates commit+tag, and optionally pushes/publishes.

External regex dataset:
- Converted rules are stored at `data/regex_list_1.json`
- By default, external rules are loaded in `coding-only` mode (focus on keys/tokens/secrets/password/private key patterns)
- Set `.privacy-guard.json` to control behavior:

```json
{
  "externalRulesJsonPath": "./data/regex_list_1.json",
  "externalRulesMode": "coding-only"
}
```

See [docs/](./docs/) for detailed architecture and integration guides.

## Privacy & Security

- ✅ All scanning happens **locally on your machine**
- ✅ No data is sent to external services
- ✅ No telemetry or tracking
- ✅ Open source and fully auditable
- ✅ The plugin only blocks - it doesn't store or log your sensitive data

## Why Block Instead of Redact?

Claude Code's hook system doesn't support transforming prompts - only blocking or adding context. Blocking ensures sensitive data **never** reaches the AI, which is the safest approach.

## Debugging

Check the debug log if you encounter issues:

```bash
cat /tmp/claude-privacy-guard.log
